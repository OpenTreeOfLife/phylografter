d3 force directed changes :

#make sure labels don't touch one another

expand 'vertical' and 'horizontal'

branch length : aestehically pleasing( how? ), or use branch length data

minor : keep labels in box

label the root( remove icon )

place the root at the bottom

differentiation ( shape or color ) of leaf nodes

after horizontal expansion, keep previous view all collapsed into one node

don't let labels touch other nodes


check out d3 tree view

check out d3 sunburst view


11/30/2011 discussion :


use plantlist, apg_taxon, and ncbi_node to populate a sunburst tree


use mutiple sunburst trees to compare
    - type in a name, highlight area in all trees
    - mouseover, same thing
    - select different data points to highlight in each tree (support values?)



force directed tree - pin node ( zero gravity, fixed ) after it is grabbed and released

re-implement search field ( label panel )
    - let user know if its collapsed
    - highlight visible nodes
    - let user edit searched for node
    - let user navigate to node


(minor) traditional cladograms branch lengths are "split late" rather than early

- add branch length selector option

- work out a menu module for each view mode

- add option to adjeust # of max tips'



12/20/2011 discussion :

#put force directed on hold for now

svgView - cladogram changes:

#make sure sure edit node works - use a dummy tree

#source tree id = 37 has an error dealing with internal nodes

#after a collapsed node is expanded horizontally - add a collapse dialogue in place of the expand hori dialogue

#after a collapse action - scroll to collapsed node

#show a descendant taxon name and # of nodes next to the collapsed ui

#add a control panel to the left side of the tree - branch length, slider scale (mousewheel?), search bar 

#the path does not look right where the lines intersect - may have to change attributes - may have to rewrite pathstring function and remove the move tos

add a circular viz layout

add a stop action to the node selector so that it stays on the node selected when a menu pops up


1/02/2011 discussion :

#internal node labels - give transparentyellow background

#vertical  expansion - don't expand entire clade - just make sure not is not collapsed

future - expand multiple nodes in one column into a draggable box

1/20 : need to make 'view descendant labels ajax' - taking up too much space


1/30 discussion :

#allow slider to adjust branch length, the vertical tip buffer, and the font-size

#maxTips should be independent of window size

#when expanding vertically, maxtips should increase 50 percent ( or what we find to be aesthetically pleasing )

#label , taxa search, when a label or taxa is selected - redraw tree ( one column ) - the node's ancestors are all in the keep visible list


2/10/12 :

create column class in phylogram view


2/20/12 :

#branch lengths : smoothed, scaled (don't is broken right now)

internal labels : yellow is opaque and on top of tree, texti s on top of this

#number of tips -> control panel slider option


2/27/2012 :

bug with clipboard names having a single quote

personal clipboard - shared clipboard ?

2/29/2012 :

add to clipboard, any modal box, have automatic text selection so the user doesn't have to manually delete the text

create panel object

3/13/20120 :

add options to rotate siblings?

ladderize everything by default ?

3/14/2012 :

redirect after login still does not work =/

give notify timeout for "dotdotdot"

fix clipboard on initial open when the content overflows

3/16 :

re evaluate slider control

areThereBranchLengths should only be called once per source tree and once per gtree edit

#collapsed node ui doesn't seem to work - probably when sizes are changed ? -- unable to reproduce

3/19

#maxtips value are aribitrary list of numbers 50, 100, 150 ..

store tree data into table so one doesn't have to recurse through it each time

determine collapsed nodes : average out number of collapsed nodes across tree

4/4/2012

after tree edit - update graft history panel

4/17/2012 :

was unable to edit tree twice using clipboard - error on clip drop

5/3/2012 :

after vertical node expansion, max tips is increased - need to update the control panel when this happens
after horizontal, vertical node expansion - we add ids to the keep visible list - this needs to be reverted at some point - i think
after a vertical expand node, a popup appears next to the expanded node to notify that it is the expanded node, when scrolling, this popup is misaligned - fix this


5/23/2012 :

#after a graft on a source tree, the graft history comes to us via ajax call, need to make sure it shows up in the right spot - should probably close the clipboard if its open

collapse clade is broken


6/31/2012 :

moving item from clipboard to graft clade - dialogue comes up. user presses escape, modal dialogue box disappears, but the clade is still highlighted


6/12/12 :

on window resize: fix sidebar header width


7/12/12:

#need to create a collapsed node object

7/19/12:

#control panel hover sizing is broken - le sigh

7/24/12:

#need to figure out what to do regarding descendant labels when a user collapses a node on a tree that is un processed


7/30/12:

#when calculating node coordinates, make sure the depth of the tree reflects the actual depth of the tree being shown, not the entire tree ( collapsed nodes )



8/20/12:

save whether nodes are collapsed / expanded ( vertically, horizontally ) in session


9/5/12:

#collapse node in column that is not an ancestor of an expanded node in the same column


9/6/12:

#while vertically scrolling after a vertical expand - make sure the node selector is node being updated


9/18/12:

collapse internal node with label - refreshed, shown label is incorrect


9/24/12:

#make all? some? config settings last for the session
#switch between scaled / smooth -> don't remove columns
#save columns ( visble, collapsed ) in session
after horizontal expand, zoom out on the previous column so that it fits on the screen
#collapsed ui should push everything to the right - not the left
minimum tips per column needed

9/27/12:

#make sure collapsed node dialogue is correct when retrieving a tree with multiple columns already open


10/8/12 :

scale collapsed node ui with size of font ?
hidden hover border is on top of view descendant labels - this shouldn't be the case


11/5/12 :

testing prune node - prune entire column for source and gtree


1/11/2013 :

after a prune clade action, I viewed the tree edits, then as I was going to prune again, the prune comment modal dialogue was too tall.  make a default height for the modal box, or reset the height after each use


1/15/2013 :

when attempting to replace or graft, the clipboard has some minor display issues



resizing window, change data tables
width

None is link to edit taxon

visual indication of sort order
